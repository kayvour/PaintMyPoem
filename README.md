📄 Full changelog → CHANGELOG.md
A Python-based tool that transforms poems into abstract art using natural language processing and simple machine learning. Choose from multiple artistic styles to match your poem's mood!


## 📝 What It Does

- Analyzes the mood and tone of the poem using NLP and sentiment analysis
- Extracts keywords and emotional themes
- **NEW:** Choose from 5 artistic styles - Vibrant, Minimalist, Ethereal, Bold, or Organic
- Generates visual elements and color palettes to match the poem and selected style
- Uses Unsplash API to add backgrounds (optional)
- Creates abstract artwork using pygame, saves it as a .png image


## 🚀 Features
### Core Analysis

- Detects emotions using TextBlob or VADER
- Extracts key themes using nltk
- Matches emotion to color palettes
- Places visual elements (shapes, patterns, swirls) based on poem keywords

### 🎨 Artistic Styles (NEW)

- **Vibrant:** Bold colors, high contrast, energetic feel
- **Minimalist:** Clean, simple shapes with limited color palette  
- **Ethereal:** Soft, dreamy with transparent layers and flowing shapes
- **Bold:** High contrast, geometric shapes, strong visual impact
- **Organic:** Natural, flowing shapes with earth-inspired colors
- **Auto-select:** Automatically picks the best style based on poem emotion

### Visual Generation

- Generates original, soft, vibrant, and vintage art variants
- Complete background image management with download and caching
- Integration with Unsplash API for nature backgrounds (sky, forest, ocean, mountains, sunset)
- Style-specific particle effects and visual elements
- Dynamic element count and sizing based on selected style
- Runs completely locally


## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kayvour/paintmypoem.git
cd paintmypoem
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Choose your experience:
   - Select interactive mode for full features
   - Use demo mode with sample poems
   - Choose from 5 artistic styles or let the AI auto-select
   - Add backgrounds or use gradient-only mode


## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Poem Analysis:** Sentiment analysis determines emotional tone (joy, sadness, anger, etc.)
2. **Keyword Extraction:** Key themes and visual words are identified (stars, rain, fire, etc.)
3. **🎨 Style Selection:** Choose your preferred artistic style or let AI auto-select
4. **Visual Planning:** Shapes, positions, and colors are mapped based on emotion, keywords, and style
5. **Background Selection:** Optional nature backgrounds from Unsplash API
6. **Art Generation:** Final artwork created using pygame with style-specific effects

### Style Examples

- **Minimalist + Sad Poem** = Clean circles, muted blues, few elements
- **Vibrant + Joyful Poem** = Bold stars, bright yellows/oranges, many elements  
- **Ethereal + Love Poem** = Soft circles, transparent pinks, flowing particles
- **Bold + Angry Poem** = Sharp triangles, high contrast reds, thick borders
- **Organic + Nature Poem** = Flowing shapes, earth tones, atmospheric effects


## 🧰 Built With

- Python 3
- Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
- TextBlob / VADER Sentiment Analysis
- pygame for art generation
- Unsplash API for background images
- Custom Style Presets System


## 📌 Notes

- Works best with short to medium poems (4-12 lines)
- Poetic imagery and emotion words improve output quality
- Each style produces distinctly different visual results
- Background images enhance the final artwork but are optional
- The sample poems in the /sample poems folder were generated using ChatGPT for demonstration


## 🔮 Future Improvements

- ✅ Add style presets
- More detailed shape variations (fractals, splines, organic forms)
- GUI version for drag-and-drop poem uploads
- Custom style creator for advanced users
- Integration with more background sources
- Create an executable release (.exe) so users can run without installing Python
- Optimize and test for longer poems with chunking/batching
- Advanced sentiment analysis with transformer models
- Animation mode for moving visualizations
- Social media sharing integration
